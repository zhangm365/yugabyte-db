The following best practices and tips can greatly improve the performance of transactions in [multi-region](../../../../explore/multi-region-deployments/) deployments.

## Place leaders in one region

In a multi-region setup, a transaction would have to reach out to the tablet leaders spread across multiple regions. In this scenario, the transaction can incur high inter-regional latencies that could multiply with the number of statements that have to travel cross-region.

Cross-region trips can be avoided by placing all the tablet leaders in one region using the [set_preferred_zones](../../../../admin/yb-admin/#set-preferred-zones) command in [yb-admin](../../../../admin/yb-admin/).

You can also do this by [marking the zones as Preferred](../../../../yugabyte-platform/manage-deployments/edit-universe/) on the **Edit Universe** page in [YugabyteDB Anywhere](../../../../yugabyte-platform/), or [setting the region as preferred](../../../../yugabyte-cloud/cloud-basics/create-clusters/create-clusters-multisync/#preferred-region) in YugabyteDB Managed.

## Read from followers

All reads in YugabyteDB are handled by the leader to ensure that applications fetch the latest data, even though the data is replicated to the followers. While replication is fast, it is not instantaneous, and the followers may not have the latest data at the read time. But in some scenarios, reading from the leader is not necessary. For example:

- The data does not change often (for example, a movie database).
- The application does not need the latest data (for example, reading yesterday's report).

In such scenarios, you can enable [follower reads](../../../../explore/ysql-language-features/going-beyond-sql/follower-reads-ysql/) to read from followers instead of going to the leader, which could be far away in a different region.

To enable follower reads, set the transaction to be [READ ONLY](../../../../api/ysql/the-sql-language/statements/txn_set/#read-only-mode) and turn on the YSQL parameter `yb_read_from_followers`. For example:

```plpgsql
SET yb_read_from_followers = true;
BEGIN TRANSACTION READ ONLY;
...
COMMIT;
```

This will read data from the closest follower or leader. As replicas may not be up-to-date with all updates, by design, this will return only stale data (default: 30s). This is the case even if the read goes to a leader. The staleness value can be changed using another setting like:

```plpgsql
SET yb_follower_read_staleness_ms = 10000; -- 10s
```

Follower reads only affect reads. All writes are still handled by the leader.
