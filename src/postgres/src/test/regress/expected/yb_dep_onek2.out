-- A collection of queries to build the onek2 table.
--
-- The queries are taken from the relevant dependency files.  Since it is
-- faster to run this rather than each file itself (e.g. dependency chain
-- create_function_1, create_type, create_table, copy, create_index), prefer
-- using this.
--
-- DEPENDENCY: this file must be run after onek has been populated (by
-- yb_dep_onek).
